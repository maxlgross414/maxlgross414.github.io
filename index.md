My academic interests include type theory, substructural logics, programming language mechanization, NLP, and functional programming.

As a member of the <a href="https://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computation and Logic Group</a>, I’m working with <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brigitte Pientka</a>, <a href="https://rak.ac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Kavanagh</a>, and Chuta Sano on mechanizing a quantum programming language based on linear logic in <a href="https://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beluga</a>. Previously, I collaborated with <a href="https://x.com/_akpiper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Piper</a> at the <a href="https://txtlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.txtlab</a> on quantitative cultural analytics.

From January until May of this year, I was in <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edinburgh</a> (also in a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Appleton+Tower,+11+Crichton+St,+Newington,+Edinburgh+EH8+9LE,+UK/@55.944568,-3.1870368,3a,75y,175.03h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1soPgFe2z4R45sQaadlAdEcA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D0%26panoid%3DoPgFe2z4R45sQaadlAdEcA%26yaw%3D175.0265!7i16384!8i8192!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x4887c783851c5b41:0x3d222164a50901a6!2sAppleton+Tower,+11+Crichton+St,+Newington,+Edinburgh+EH8+9LE,+UK!3b1!8m2!3d55.9443771!4d-3.1870091!16zL20vMGM2MTJw!3m5!1s0x4887c783851c5b41:0x3d222164a50901a6!8m2!3d55.9443771!4d-3.1870091!16zL20vMGM2MTJw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tall, ugly</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070805081347/http://www.sykes.easynet.co.uk/jones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"wonder of the world"</a> building). I studied the categorical semantics of quantum programming languages under <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cheunen/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Heunen</a>  and algorithmic game theory under <a href="https://arisfilosratsikas.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aris Filos-Ratsikas</a>. I also joined  <a href="https://typesig.pl/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeSig</a>, a student-run research group in type theory, programming languages, and semantics where I played with <a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural numbers</a> before the heading off to the pub. 

I am currently a summer research student at <a href="https://www.dal.ca/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dalhousie University</a> in Halifax, Nova Scotia (in a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chase+Building/@44.6373878,-63.5930206,3a,75y,210.67h,94.93t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s7dE29xvgUT_7QT8GpveEhQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-4.9293190521001975%26panoid%3D7dE29xvgUT_7QT8GpveEhQ%26yaw%3D210.66798655655154!7i16384!8i8192!4m9!3m8!1s0x4b5a2224663af3df:0x9ec233056d32a370!8m2!3d44.6370876!4d-63.5930782!10e5!14m1!1BCgIgARICCAI!16s%2Fg%2F11hbv1zxkc?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYzMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">much nicer building</a>).

Outside school, I enjoy <a href="/crosswords">crosswords</a>, bouldering, data science, and writing. I’m open to connecting for research or internships — reach out if we share interests! I'll be applying for grad schools in Canada and abroad for Fall 2026 entry.
