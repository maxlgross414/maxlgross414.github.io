I study Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McGill University</a> in a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Burnside+Hall/@45.5045322,-73.57476,3a,75y,306.94h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sTKqSbkZmchvkCg0PrlqrAQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D0%26panoid%3DTKqSbkZmchvkCg0PrlqrAQ%26yaw%3D306.93597!7i13312!8i6656!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x4cc91a47aeafb055:0xaf6425f171b21f2c!2sBurnside+Hall!8m2!3d45.5046107!4d-73.574909!16s%2Fm%2F02psb0q!3m5!1s0x4cc91a47aeafb055:0xaf6425f171b21f2c!8m2!3d45.5046107!4d-73.574909!16s%2Fm%2F02psb0q?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13-story, brutalist rectangular prism</a>. My academic interests include type theory, substructural logics, programming language mechanization, NLP, and functional programming.

As a member of the <a href="https://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computation and Logic Group</a>, I’m working with <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brigitte Pientka</a>, <a href="https://rak.ac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Kavanagh</a>, and Chuta Sano on mechanizing a quantum programming language based on linear logic in <a href="https://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beluga</a>. Previously, I collaborated with <a href="https://x.com/_akpiper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Piper</a> at the <a href="https://txtlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.txtlab</a> on quantitative cultural analytics.

Outside school, I enjoy crosswords, bouldering, data science, and writing. I’m open to connecting for research or internships this summer in Canada or abroad. I’ll be in Edinburgh for an exchange semester starting January (also in a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Appleton+Tower,+11+Crichton+St,+Newington,+Edinburgh+EH8+9LE,+UK/@55.944568,-3.1870368,3a,75y,175.03h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1soPgFe2z4R45sQaadlAdEcA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D0%26panoid%3DoPgFe2z4R45sQaadlAdEcA%26yaw%3D175.0265!7i16384!8i8192!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x4887c783851c5b41:0x3d222164a50901a6!2sAppleton+Tower,+11+Crichton+St,+Newington,+Edinburgh+EH8+9LE,+UK!3b1!8m2!3d55.9443771!4d-3.1870091!16zL20vMGM2MTJw!3m5!1s0x4887c783851c5b41:0x3d222164a50901a6!8m2!3d55.9443771!4d-3.1870091!16zL20vMGM2MTJw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tall, ugly</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070805081347/http://www.sykes.easynet.co.uk/jones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"wonder of the world"</a> building) —let’s connect if we share interests!
